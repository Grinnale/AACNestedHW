This project creates an AAC device. 
It loads a GUI with options to open categories, speak words, add new categories/words, and save the configuration into a file.
The AACMappings.java file makes AACMappings that hold all of its categories and their images.
The AACCategories.java file makes AACCategories that hold word/image pairs to be spoken.
